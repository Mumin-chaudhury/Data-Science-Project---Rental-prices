My justifications 

Renovation (54.8%): This was the most significant predictor among discrete features. Renovated apartments are typically in better condition, offer updated amenities, and are more desirable, justifying their higher rental rates. 

Balcony (32.1%): Properties with balconies offer additional space and lifestyle benefits, especially in urban areas. This explains their strong contribution to rental price. 

Children_are_welcome (9.3%): This suggests the apartment accommodates families, often indicating larger units with more amenities and therefore higher prices.
